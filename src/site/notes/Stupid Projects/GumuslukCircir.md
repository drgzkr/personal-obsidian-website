## What?
This notebook was born out of boredom and curiosity during my short vacation in Gumusluk, Bodrum.
Several cicadas were around the house of my friend who hosted a group of us for a week, who were quite chatty (both us and the cicadas).
Here is one which joined us during one of our card playing sessions:

One morning, I was reading on the balcony, and was accompanied by a few of these loud high-chitin friends. I decided to ignore their privacy and recorded them without their consent.
Here are some simple analysis done on that recording that takes a closer look at the cicada song at a very basic level.
