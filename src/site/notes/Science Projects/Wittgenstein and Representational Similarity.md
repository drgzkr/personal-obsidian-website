## What?

A concept I’ve been chewing on: drawing a formal bridge between Wittgenstein’s late philosophy of language, specifically his notion of family resemblances, and how we now study neural representations in cognitive neuroscience using tools like Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA).

Put simply: I think there’s a useful and underappreciated **isomorphism** between **the way meaning emerges in language (according to Wittgenstein)** and the way meaning or content is **encoded in distributed neural population codes.**

It’s still a rough idea, but I’d like to polish it into a short perspective or opinion paper. The goal is to sketch a common conceptual language for discussing high-level semantics (philosophy of language) and low-level neurocomputational implementation (brain activity patterns), with RSA as the bridge.

## Why?

In Wittgenstein’s late work (think: Philosophical Investigations), he introduces the concept of “family resemblances”: the idea that category membership is defined not by a single common feature but by a web of overlapping similarities. Think of how “game” includes chess, tag, football, and solitaire, all of which related, but in different ways.

Now consider how RSA works in neuroscience: we build a representational similarity matrix (RSM) where the pairwise similarity between activation patterns tells us how concepts are related in the brain. Concepts that share more neural activation features are “closer together.” Importantly, these similarities are graded and overlapping — not defined by any single feature or “neural label.”

RSA operationalizes something very close to Wittgenstein’s philosophical insight.

## The idea

I want to:

- Show how RSA and family resemblances share a core structural logic (similarity spaces, relational identity, context-dependence).
- Explore how this framing challenges essentialist views of meaning and representation (in both domains).
- Sketch how this analogy could be useful for future interdisciplinary work, e.g., making sense of neural embeddings from language models, or clarifying what kinds of semantic spaces different brain regions encode.

## In progress

This is just an idea dump for now. If you're reading this and you:

- Work on language or representation in philosophy or neuroscience,
- Are annoyed by bad metaphorical uses of “language of thought,”
- Want to yell at me for misusing Wittgenstein or RSA,

get in touch. Let’s argue.
