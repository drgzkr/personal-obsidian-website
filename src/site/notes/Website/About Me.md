I'm a **computational cognitive neuroscientist** and **AI researcher** exploring how the brain processes **continuous, naturalistic** information and segments it into meaningful events. 

My work bridges **neuroscience**, **artificial intelligence**, and **cognitive** **psychology** to understand the fundamental mechanisms of how we make sense of our complex, ever-changing world.

## [[Website/Science\|Science]]

My research focuses on **event segmentation** (how the brain divides continuous experiences into discrete, meaningful chunks) and understanding **continuous** **naturalistic** neural activity **across scales**. This work often shifts from traditional tightly-controlled neuroscience toward understanding how the brain actually functions during real-world-like experiences.

**Current Research Areas:**

- **Neural Dynamics & Event Processing** - Using fMRI to investigate how neural states work across brain regions during naturalistic viewing
- **Computational Modeling** - Building artificial neural networks to model brain function and test hypotheses about temporal dynamics of neural representations
- **Memory & Hippocampus** - Exploring how event boundaries influence memory encoding and retrieval during naturalistic experiences
- **Methodological Innovation** - Developing novel algorithms and data-driven approaches for analyzing continuous neural data

I'm particularly excited about... 

## Education & Training

My academic journey reflects my commitment to bridging disciplines:

**PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence** | Current  

**MSc in Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience** |  2018-2020

**BSc in Psychology** | Minor in Bio-Psy & Research | 2015-2018

This progression from psychology through clinical/cognitive neuroscience to computational neuroscience and AI has given me a unique perspective on brain function, linking the psychological, biological, and the computational principles underlying cognition.

## Teaching & Mentorship

I taught graduate and undergraduate courses like:
- **Methods and Techniques of Research**, 
- **Perception**, 
- **Critical Thinking**,  
- **History and Foundations of Psychology**,
- **Body and Behaviour**,
- **Deep Learning**,
- **AI for Neurotech**,
- 

I've also **supervised** students on **BSc** and **MSc** **research** projects, mainly focusing on fMRI data, either modelling it with traditional or novel deep learning approaches; or comparing it with artificial neural networks and their internal mechanisms.
