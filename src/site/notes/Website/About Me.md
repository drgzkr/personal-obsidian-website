I'm a **computational cognitive neuroscientist** (and a bit of an **AI researcher**) exploring how the brain processes **continuous, naturalistic** information. 

My work bounces around **neuroscience**, **artificial intelligence**, and **cognitive** **psychology** to understand the fundamental mechanisms of how we (and perhaps others (un)like us) make sense of the complex, ever-changing world.

## Science

My most recent research focuses on **event segmentation** (how the brain divides continuous experiences into discrete, meaningful chunks), **neural states** and understanding **continuous** **naturalistic** neural activity **across spatiotemporal scales**. This work often shifts from traditional tightly-controlled neuroscience toward understanding how the brain actually functions during real-world-like experiences.

*If you like bullet-point lists, some of my research areas are:*

- **Neural Dynamics & Event Processing** - Using fMRI to investigate how neural states work across brain regions during naturalistic viewing
- **Computational Modeling** - Building/Using artificial neural networks to model brain function and test hypotheses about spatial and/or temporal dynamics of neural representations and cognition
- **Memory & Hippocampus** - Exploring how event or neural state boundaries influence memory encoding and retrieval during naturalistic experiences
- **Methodological Exploration** - Developing algorithms and data-driven approaches for analyzing continuous neural data

## Education

My academic journey looks smt like this:

**PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence** | Ongoing  

**MSc in Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience** |  2018-2020

**BSc in Psychology**  *(minor in Bio-Psy & Research)* | 2015-2018

This progression from psychology through clinical/cognitive neuroscience to computational neuroscience and AI has given me a unique perspective on brain function, linking the psychological, biological, and the computational principles underlying cognition.

## Teaching

I have been involved in graduate and undergraduate courses like:
- **Methods and Techniques of Research**, 
- **Perception**, 
- **Critical Thinking**,  
- **History and Foundations of Psychology**,
- **Body and Behaviour**,
- **Deep Learning**,
- **AI for Neurotech**
with varying capacities.

I've also **supervised** students on **BSc** and **MSc** **research** projects, ranging from traditional and/or  deep learning modelling of fMRI data (or comparing it with artificial neural networks and their internal mechanisms) to automating behavior detection from video data.

 I've been fortunate to go through almost all of my higher education with **problem based learning (PBL)** at both ends of the teaching/learning journey. I stand by its principles and think they offer a very solid set of heuristics to teach how to learn. 
## My Vision - Why I do what I do

Honestly, I'm very confused...
