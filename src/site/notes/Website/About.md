I'm a computational cognitive neuroscientist and AI researcher exploring how the brain processes continuous, naturalistic information and segments it into meaningful events. My work bridges neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology to understand the fundamental mechanisms of how we make sense of our complex, ever-changing world.

## Research

My research focuses on **event segmentation**—how the brain divides continuous experiences into discrete, meaningful chunks. I've discovered that this process relies on **neural states**: stable patterns of brain activity that coincide with events in the stimuli we encounter. This work represents a significant shift from traditional laboratory-based neuroscience toward understanding how the brain actually functions during real-world experiences.

My breakthrough research, published in a top-tier neuroscience journal, demonstrated that neural state boundaries are organized in a temporal cortical hierarchy, with short states in primary sensory regions and longer states in prefrontal areas. This study, which has been cited over 40 times, revealed that perceived event boundaries overlap with neural state boundaries across large parts of the cortical hierarchy—providing crucial evidence for how the brain naturally segments continuous experience.

**Current Research Areas:**

- **Neural Dynamics & Event Processing** - Using fMRI and intracranial recordings to investigate how neural states propagate across brain regions during naturalistic viewing
- **Computational Modeling** - Building artificial neural networks to model brain function and test hypotheses about temporal dynamics of neural representations
- **Memory & Hippocampus** - Exploring how event boundaries influence memory encoding and retrieval during naturalistic experiences
- **Methodological Innovation** - Developing novel algorithms and data-driven approaches for analyzing continuous neural data

I'm particularly excited about my recent work using **intracranial recordings** to study neural state propagation with millisecond precision—the first study of its kind in event segmentation research. This work is revealing how top-down and bottom-up processes coordinate during event processing.

## Education & Training

My academic journey reflects my commitment to bridging disciplines:

**PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence** | Current  
_Working in a dynamic naturalistic cognitive neuroscience lab_

**MSc in Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience** | Honor's Programme Premium

**BSc in Psychology** | Research Honor's Programme  
_Published undergraduate research on neural representations using fMRI_

This progression from psychology through clinical neuroscience to computational neuroscience has given me a unique perspective on brain function—understanding both the biological mechanisms and the computational principles underlying cognition.

## Teaching & Mentorship

I'm passionate about training the next generation of researchers who can work across disciplinary boundaries. I teach graduate courses in **Deep Learning** and **AI for Neurotech**, where students learn to apply cutting-edge AI methods to real neuroscience problems. Whether we're discussing how transformer architectures might relate to attention mechanisms in the brain or building tools for analyzing naturalistic neural data, these courses bridge theory and application.

I also supervise students on research projects, helping them navigate the challenges of interdisciplinary work. From training students in fMRI data collection to mentoring them through their first experiences with neural state analysis, I'm committed to hands-on education that produces capable, independent researchers.

My teaching experience spans foundational courses in research methods, perception, and behavior to advanced seminars, always emphasizing the connection between traditional neuroscience and modern computational approaches.

## Impact & Recognition

My work has contributed both theoretical insights and practical tools to the field. The neural state boundary detection methods I've developed are being adopted by researchers worldwide, advancing our ability to study brain function during naturalistic conditions. My recent publications on how environmental features are reflected in neural states and temporal propagation represent continued momentum in this research program.

Working at a prestigious research institute, I collaborate with international researchers across multiple continents. My commitment to open science—publishing in open-access journals and sharing data and code—ensures that methodological innovations benefit the broader research community.

## Vision

The future of neuroscience lies in understanding how the brain works in its natural environment, not just in controlled laboratory settings. By combining naturalistic experimental approaches with sophisticated computational models and AI techniques, we can unlock new insights into consciousness, memory, and cognition.

My research addresses fundamental questions: How does the brain parse continuous experience into episodes that can be remembered? How do global and local neural dynamics coordinate during natural viewing? How can AI methods both model brain function and advance our analytical capabilities?

The intersection of neuroscience and AI isn't just about using one to understand the other—it's about recognizing that both natural and artificial intelligence face the same fundamental challenge of making sense of complex, dynamic information. Understanding these mechanisms will benefit both basic science and practical applications in brain-computer interfaces, AI systems, and treatments for cognitive disorders.
