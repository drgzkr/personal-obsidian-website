I'm a **computational cognitive neuroscientist** and **AI researcher** exploring how the brain processes **continuous, naturalistic** information and segments it into meaningful events. 

My work bridges **neuroscience**, **artificial intelligence**, and **cognitive** **psychology** to understand the fundamental mechanisms of how we make sense of our complex, ever-changing world.

## [[Website/Science\|Science]]

My research focuses on **event segmentation**â€”how the brain divides continuous experiences into discrete, meaningful chunks. I've discovered that this process relies on **neural states**: stable patterns of brain activity that coincide with events in the stimuli we encounter. This work represents a significant shift from traditional laboratory-based neuroscience toward understanding how the brain actually functions during real-world experiences.

**Current Research Areas:**

- **Neural Dynamics & Event Processing** - Using fMRI and intracranial recordings to investigate how neural states propagate across brain regions during naturalistic viewing
- **Computational Modeling** - Building artificial neural networks to model brain function and test hypotheses about temporal dynamics of neural representations
- **Memory & Hippocampus** - Exploring how event boundaries influence memory encoding and retrieval during naturalistic experiences
- **Methodological Innovation** - Developing novel algorithms and data-driven approaches for analyzing continuous neural data

I'm particularly excited about

## Education & Training

My academic journey reflects my commitment to bridging disciplines:

**PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence** | Current  

**MSc in Clinical and Cognitive Neuroscience** | Premium Honor's Programme 

**BSc in Psychology** | Minor in Bio-Psy & Research via Marble Honor's Programme  
_Published undergraduate research on neural representations using fMRI_

This progression from psychology through clinical/cognitive neuroscience to computational neuroscience has given me a unique perspective on brain function, linking the psychological, biological, and the computational principles underlying cognition.

## Teaching & Mentorship

I taught graduate courses like:
- **Methods and Techniques of Research**, 
- **Perception**, 
- **Critical Thinking**,  
- **Deep Learning**,
- **AI for Neurotech**
- 

I've also supervised students on BSc and MSc research projects, mainly focusing on fMRI data, either modelling it with traditional or novel deep learning approaches; or comparing it with artificial neural networks and their internal mechanisms.
