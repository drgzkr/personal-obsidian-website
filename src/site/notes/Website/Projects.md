# Sinbeddings

</div>


## What?

See the sin trajectory of any sequence of events.
Given a text with multiple sentences, an LLM codes each sentence based on how much of which 7 sin is present. 
The dashboard then visualizes the sib-journey of the text with an animated radar plot and state space trajectory made up of 2 principal components of the whole sinbedding timeline.
The dimensions are also interpreted based on which sin is loaded in them to characterize a unique sin-space for the text.

Play with it by giving it biographies, or known literary texts, or your own stories.

## What?
This little pipeline pulls a random Wikipedia article and creates a text to speech dictation of it using coqui-tts.
It then loads a long video, chops it to the length of the audio file, adds the text of the speech (at correct timestamps) to the video, and saves the corresponding video file.

TLDR: Free TikTok Brainrot Generator

## What?
This notebook was born out of boredom and curiosity during my short vacation in Gumusluk, Bodrum.
Several cicadas were around the house of my friend who hosted a group of us for a week, who were quite chatty (both us and the cicadas).
Here is one which joined us during one of our card playing sessions:

One morning, I was reading on the balcony, and was accompanied by a few of these loud high-chitin friends. I decided to ignore their privacy and recorded them without their consent.
Here are some simple analysis done on that recording that takes a closer look at the cicada song at a very basic level.

Here are some figures:
